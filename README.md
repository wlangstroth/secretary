# secretary

The knowledge of a perfect robot secretary to be used as a prosthetic brain. An
exercise in learning Common Lisp. A lot of the code is straight out of Practical
Lisp, and the rest probably isn't very good.

The knowledge is organized into "events". Things that are events:

* Kid events, like bath times, television start/stop times
* Appointments
* Deadlines
* Grocery items added/removed from lists
* Trades
* Todos

## Code

This is a learning lisp project, so the majority of it is based on Peter
Seibel's Practical Lisp book, which has
[a permissive license](https://github.com/gigamonkey/pcl-practicals/blob/master/LICENSE).

I would recommend looking at his code instead of this code.
